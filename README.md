# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room currently has a game, Draw It or Lose It, available in an Android app. They wanted me to develop a web-based game that would serve multiple platforms based on their Draw It or Lose It game. Some of the software requirements were as follows: that the game would allow one or more teams to participate with multiple players assigned to each team, that team names, player names, and game names must be individual, and that unique identifiers need to be created for each occurence of a game, team, or player. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Things I did well in developing this documentation is professionally communicating the design requirements, explaining the UML diagram so that it was simple to understand, and communicating the pros and cons of different operating platforms. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The most helpful part of working through a design document while developing code was that I was able to ensure client expectations were met. Similar to writing pseudocode, working through a design document gave me a clearer picture of what the end goal of the program was. This allowed me to create the desired program quicker and more efficiently than if the design document were not completed. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
One of the user's needs was to have a web-based game that would be compatible with multiple operating platforms. Remembering that, I created a server that would work with multiple operating systems. I also created a server that would ensure only one instance of Draw It or Lose It could exist in memory at a time. 
It is important to consider the user's needs when designing so that they can have the best experience while using the program. If a program is poorly designed, it will not only give the user a bad experience, but it will also affect the user's relationship with the client. I want both the user and client to have successful experiences and positive effects from the program I create for them. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In designing the software, I considered the client design requirements to ensure that their desires would be met in the program I created. I also considered the security risks with a server program and used best practices to protect the user and client from security breaches.
